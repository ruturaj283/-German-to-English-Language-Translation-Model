# 🌐 German-to-English Language Translation Model

This repository contains the code for a deep learning-based language translation model that translates German text into English. The model is built using TensorFlow and Hugging Face's transformers library, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing.

<b>Code File (german_to_english.ipynb)</b>

The translate.py script is the main Python file for running the translation model. It contains the necessary code to load the trained model, process input text, and generate translations. You can customize the input and output files as needed.


<b>Model Weight File (ge_engModel)</b>

The model_weights.h5 file contains the trained weights of the language translation model. These weights are specific to the training process and architecture used in this project.

🚀 Key Features:

High-Quality Translation: Achieves accurate and fluent translations across various domains, from news articles to literature.
Easy Integration: Simple and straightforward integration into existing applications or workflows.
Customization: Easily fine-tune the model for specific domains or use cases using transfer learning techniques.
Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of text efficiently, making it suitable for real-time translation applications.
